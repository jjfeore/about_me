    Did I end up getting any kind of math or science degree in college? &nbsp; <em><span="field2"></span></em><br />
    Did I serve in a combat role in the Army? &nbsp; <em><span="field3"></span></em><br />
    Did I enjoy my last job? &nbsp; <em><span="field4"></span></em><br />
    Am I enjoying Code Fellows so far? &nbsp; <em><span="field5"></span></em><br />
    Name one of the top 3 places I want to visit: &nbsp; <em><span="field6"></span></em><br />
