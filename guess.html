    <h2>QUESTIONS ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
    We're going to play a guessing game about me. First question: Do I seem like the kind of guy who attended boarding school?&nbsp;<br />
    Did I end up getting any kind of math or science degree in college?&nbsp; <br />
    Did I serve in a combat role in the Army?&nbsp;<br />
    Did I enjoy my last job?&nbsp;<br />
    Am I enjoying Code Fellows so far? &nbsp;<br />
