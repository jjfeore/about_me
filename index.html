    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

    <section class="contentBox">
      <section class="left">
        <h2>CHILDHOOD</h2>
        <p class="info">I grew up on the island of Guam, but left when I turned 16. I had grown rebellious, and I just wanted out of the house. When I discovered that Alabama had a state-run boarding school, the <em>Alabama School of Math and Science</em>, and that I technically qualified as a state resident by using a relative's address, I applied and left home.</p>

        <h2>COLLEGE</h2>
        <p class="info">After graduating, I started work on a BS in Computer Science at GATech. Eventually, I came to the realization that I simply didn't enjoy computer science, and I rushed to finish the quickest, cheapest degree I could. I returned to Guam and enrolled in the University of Guam, where I knocked out 100+ credit hours of a <em>Political Science degree</em> in a year.</p>

          <h2>US ARMY</h2>
          <p class="info">Once I got my BA, I joined the Army as a college-option Officer Candidate. I completed Basic Training and Officer Candidate School to receive my commission as an <em>Engineer Officer</em>. I spent 5 more years in, during which time I had the opportunity to lead two platoons in combat and bring them both home safely.</p>

        <h2>RECOLOGY</h2>
        <p class="info">Getting out of the Army, I looked for an operations job that would allow me to transition to a civilian career. At another job interview, the interviewer recommended that I look at Recology as well, and said they would put in a good word for me over there. I followed their advice and got a job there as a <em>Route Manager</em>. Despite doing well at the job, I hated it and ended up quitting after two years.</p>

        <h2>RIGHT NOW</h2>
        <p class="info">Now, I'm looking to transition careers one more time. My wife works as a full-time broadcaster on Twitch, and my work as her channel manager has really provoked my interest in the industry. I am hoping to the time I spend at <em>Code Fellows</em> will help prepare me for a career in the online broadcasting industry.</p>
